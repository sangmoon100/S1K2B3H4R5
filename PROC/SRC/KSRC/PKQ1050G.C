  *** This file is SOSD.  Porters must change the data types ***

  **************************************************************

  If the symbol SQLCA_STORAGE_CLASS is defined, then the SQLCA
  will be defined to have this storage class. For example:
 
    #define SQLCA_STORAGE_CLASS extern
 
  will define the SQLCA as an extern.
 
  If the symbol SQLCA_INIT is defined, then the SQLCA will be
  statically initialized. Although this is not necessary in order
  to use the SQLCA, it is a good pgming practice not to have
  unitialized variables. However, some C compilers/OS's don't
  allow automatic variables to be init'd in this manner. Therefore,
  if you are INCLUDE'ing the SQLCA in a place where it would be
  an automatic AND your C compiler/OS doesn't allow this style
  of initialization, then SQLCA_INIT should be left undefined --
  all others can define SQLCA_INIT if they wish.

  If the symbol SQLCA_NONE is defined, then the SQLCA variable will
  not be defined at all.  The symbol SQLCA_NONE should not be defined
  in source modules that have embedded SQL.  However, source modules
  that have no embedded SQL, but need to manipulate a sqlca struct
  passed in as a parameter, can set the SQLCA_NONE symbol to avoid
  creation of an extraneous sqlca variable.
